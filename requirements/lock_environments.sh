# This script is used to lock the environments in the torch_tpu repository.
#
# Dependencies are defined in the standard pyproject.toml file. uv allows
# dependencies to be locked in the requirements.txt format.
#
# Usage:
#   Install uv following the instructions if you haven't already:
#     https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
#   Navigate to the directory containing the pyproject.toml file.
#   Run this script.
#     $ ./requirements/lock_environments.sh
