"""CompileConfig specifies how to run torch.compile() on the benchmark.

This is a declarative modifier on the benchmark spec, applied by the harness.
Supports two compilation scopes:

  scope="model"
      torch.compile(model). Compiles the forward pass. For training benchmarks,
      the backward pass is compiled via AOTAutograd. The optimizer step stays
      eager.

  scope="step"
      Wraps the whole forward (+ backward + optimizer.step() for training)
      region in one torch.compile.
