"""Target: framework-agnostic hardware descriptor, selected by an environment variable.

Instead of detecting the hardware at runtime, the platform is declared using the
environment variable "BENCHMARK_PLATFORM". This variable must be set to one of
a fixed set of Platform enum values, and that name fully determines the Target.
This is to avoid loading PyTorch/JAX here which can conflict to hold device
lockfiles.
