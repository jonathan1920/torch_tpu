  def await_result(self, out: Any) -> None:
    """Block until the work that produced "out" has actually completed.

    Why await_result takes the step's output:
      - torch: torch.cuda.synchronize() is a device-level barrier. It takes
        nothing and blocks on everything queued. The out argument is ignored.
      - torchax: jax.block_until_ready(out) is value-level. It blocks on the
        futures reachable from out and nothing else. This creates an obligation:
        a torchax step fn must return everything it produced, not just the loss.
        block_until_ready(loss) completes the loss future while the
        parameter and optimizer-state updates are still in flight. This causes
        the clock to stop early and the training step time is silently
        under-reported.
    A single zero-arg sync() cannot express both. Passing the step's output
    through, untouched, lets each backend do the right thing.

    Implementations may ignore out if they use a device-level barrier instead
    of value-level futures.

    await_result is explicitly defined instead of being
    embedded in step_fn to allow flexibility in device time measurement using
    events API in future.
