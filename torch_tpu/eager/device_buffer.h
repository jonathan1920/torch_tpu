// This library holds the core internal representation of the "data" of a
// tensor in TorchTPU.
//
// In Torch/CUDA or Torch/CPU, a c10::DataPtr points to an output buffer, that
// contains the data backing the tensor. This data may be in-flight, pending an
// asynchronous computation, but every new c10::DataPtr represents a physical
// block of device memory.
//
// In TorchTPU, however, a c10::DataPtr may point to either a materialized
// output buffer, **or** a deferred operation that can produce it. This deferred
// operation allows us to build a graph incrementally, and merge them into a
// larger compilation unit. It also means that we do not need to persist every
// intermediate tensor; only the tensors which have their data moved off-device
// are strictly necessary to materialize to a physical buffer.
//
// However, there is some complexity introduced by the fact that one aten
// operation can produce multiple outputs; this is common for normalization
// functions (e.g. layer norm, batch norm, group norm). This means that deferred
// operations are not one-to-one with individual tensors.
//
// This requires a three-part recursive graph structure:
///  - A DeviceBufferRef represents the data of a single tensor. It is nothing
//     more than a shared pointer to a DeviceBufferList and an index into that
//     list.
//   - A DeviceBufferList represents the data that was, or could be, produced by
//     a single aten operation. Since an aten operation may produce multiple
//     tensors, a DeviceBufferList can contain multiple DeviceBufferRefs. If the
//     operation is deferred, it has a DeferredOp; otherwise it usually
//     contains one or more PjRtBuffers (see note below).
//   - A DeferredOp represents a single aten operation that has not yet been
//     executed. It contains a list of DeviceBufferRefs that represent the
//     inputs to the operation.
//
// While "materialized" and "deferred" are the most common states, one special
// "dataless" case also exists. To support full-graph compiled mode, we know the
// shapes and dtypes of inputs in advance, but we need to trace the FX graph
// without real data. For this, we define a "placeholder" state, which
// represents a tensor that will be provided in the future when the compiled
// function is executed.
//
// This is generally a low-level implementation detail that should be invisible
// to most users of PyTorch or libtorch; the at::Tensors at the surface level
// should "just work", matching the observable semantics of CUDA eager ops.
//
// Internally, most aten kernel registrations should not need to directly use
// DeviceBufferList or DeviceBufferRef, instead using the higher-level
// abstractions provided in op_dispatcher.h and other utility libraries.
