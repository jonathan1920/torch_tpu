// When an aten op is dispatched, we always create a DeviceBufferList to contain
// the result. This DeviceBufferList will contain a DeferredOp, which describes
// the MLIR necessary to compute the return value of the aten function.
//
// At some point in the future, we may need the actual data for one or more
// tensors/buffers in the DeviceBufferList; this process is called
// materialization, and the behavior depends on the previous state.
//   - If the DeviceBufferList was alread fully materialized, no-op.
//   - If the DeviceBufferList has a DeferredOp, then that DeferredOp will be
//     compiled (or retrieved from the cache) and executed, and the
//     DeviceBufferList will be updated to hold the results.
//   - Compiled mode placeholder buffers cannot be materialized, as they
//     represent data that does not exist during compilation. It is an error to
//     call Materialize during the compilation phase of torch.compile.
