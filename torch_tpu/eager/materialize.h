// When an aten op is dispatched, we always create a DeviceBufferList to contain
// the result. Typically, this will contain a DeferredOp, which describes the
// MLIR necessary to execute the op at some point in the future. Less commonly,
// the DeviceBufferList may instead contain zero-sized buffers,
// or empty/meta buffers (such as by torch.empty()).
//
// At some point in the future, we may need the actual data for one or more
// tensors/buffers in the DeviceBufferList; this process is called
// materialization, and the behavior depends on the previous state.
//   - If the DeviceBufferList was alread fully materialized, no-op.
//   - If the DeviceBufferList has a DeferredOp, then that DeferredOp will be
//     compiled (or retrieved from the cache) and executed, and the
//     DeviceBufferList will be updated to hold the results.
//   - Zero-sized buffers in the DeviceBufferList do not need any data, so
//     materialization is typically a no-op. However, if a DeferredOp produces
//     a mix of zero-sized and non-zero-sized buffers, then the entire op must
//     be executed, which will produce some redundant zero-sized PjRtBuffers.
//   - Empty/meta buffers cannot be materialized, as they are purely placeholder
//     buffers for compile-only warm-up runs, or out-tensor assignments to be
//     overwritten.
