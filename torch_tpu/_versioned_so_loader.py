"""Runtime dispatch of PyTorch-version-specific torch_tpu C++ extensions.

torch_tpu bundles a thin `.so` glue per supported PyTorch build, each named
`<module>_<major>_<minor>_<patch>.so` (e.g. `env_2_12_0.so`). A
`MetaPathFinder` installed at import time rewrites imports of
`torch_tpu._internal.<module>` to the glue that matches the installed PyTorch,
and an `ExtensionProxyLoader` bridges the artifact's version-suffixed filename
to the unversioned `PyInit_<module>` symbol the C++ code actually exports.

Selection policy: a new glue is added to the wheel only when a PyTorch release
breaks ABI compatibility with the previous glue, so each glue serves every
release from its own version up to (but not including) the next glue's -- and
the newest glue serves everything after it, including releases newer than any
we built for. The loader therefore picks the newest glue whose version is <=
the installed PyTorch. Loading eagerly binds its symbols (the glues are linked
with `-z now`), so an ABI-incompatible glue fails loudly at import rather
than crashing later. If the installed PyTorch version cannot be determined
while versioned glues exist, or predates every built glue, that is an error.
When no versioned glues are present at all (e.g. an unversioned developer
build) the hook is not installed and imports resolve normally.

A dev build's version compares by the release triple it leads up to
(`2.14.0.dev20260711` -> `2.14.0`), so the glue the nightly-channel wheel
bundles -- built against a pinned dev snapshot and named by that snapshot's
release triple, like any other glue -- serves it whenever present.
