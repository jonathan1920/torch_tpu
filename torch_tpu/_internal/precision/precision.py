  """Context manager to set op precisions.

  This provides a direct binding to the StableHLO precision configuration. It is
  primarily used for operations involving matrix multiplication (e.g.,
  matmul and convolution). On TPU, float32 matrix multiplications are natively
  executed in bfloat16. This context manager allows you to increase the
  precision of these operations, mapping directly to StableHLO precision
  settings.

  WARNING: This has different behavior compared to
  `torch.set_float32_matmul_precision` which has unpredictable precision
  behavior across varying GPUs. While StableHLO ops are generally stable, their
  lowering to device-specific ISA is not fully documented, and as a result
  precision may vary across different hardware.

  Args:
      mode: The precision to use. Must be a Precision enum. See the StableHLO
        documentation for details on the numerical behavior of each mode:
        https://openxla.org/stablehlo/spec#dot_general

  Yields:
      None
