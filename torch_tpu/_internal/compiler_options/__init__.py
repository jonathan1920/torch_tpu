def custom_compiler_options(options: dict[str, str]):
  """Context manager for setting the XLA compiler options.

  Args:
    options: A dictionary of XLA compiler options. The key is the option name,
      and the value is the option value.  In addition, we also support these
      special options: "xla_optimization_level": the XLA optimization level.
      Valid options are 'O0', 'O1', 'O2', 'O3'. "xla_memory_fitting_level": the
      XLA memory fitting level. Valid options are 'O0', 'O1', 'O2', 'O3'. See
      EffortLevel in
      https://github.com/openxla/xla/blob/main/xla/xla.proto for more details.

  For example:
    with custom_compiler_options({
        "xla_optimization_level": "O1",
        "xla_tpu_enable_deduplicated_calls": "ENABLED",
    }):
      result = torch.matmul(torch.ones((1, 1)), torch.ones((1, 1)))
      result.to("cpu")

  All operations *materialized* within the context will use the provided
  compiler options.

  When nested, compile options overrides from the inner context merge with the
  outer context, with the inner options taking precedence.

  For example:
    with custom_compiler_options({"xla_optimization_level": "O1"}):
      outer = torch.matmul(...)
      outer.to("cpu")  # Compiled with {"xla_optimization_level": "O1"}

      with custom_compiler_options({"xla_optimization_level": "O2"}):
        inner = torch.matmul(...)
        inner.to("cpu")  # Compiled with {"xla_optimization_level": "O2"}
  """

  # See
  # https://openxla.org/xla/flags_guidance
  # for available options.
  try:
    compiler.push_compiler_options(options)
    yield
  finally:
    compiler.pop_compiler_options()


# PEP 8 requires this to be a list of strings, not a tuple or a list of objects.
__all__ = [
    # go/keep-sorted start
    "custom_compiler_options",
    # go/keep-sorted end
]
