"""Topology-aware DeviceMesh construction for TorchTPU.

Launchers may assign assign global rank ids with no topology input, so we need
to assume that the rank -> chip mapping is arbitrary. Therefore, the standard
sequential assignment of torch ranks may place logically adjacent mesh
coordinates on physically distant devices.

This module serves two purposes:
1. Topology mapping: rank's physical device coordinates are collected via an
   all_gather, making the resulting mesh correct and independent of the
   spawner's rank assignment.
2. Assignment: on top of the recovered physical layout, a device mesh build
   algorithm is used to compute a suitable logical-to-physical assignment using
   per-generation placement handlers and a N-D torus axis-assignment logic.

Note: `mesh_shape` follows the JAX convention — axes ordered by increasing
network intensity, i.e. the highest-traffic axis last. This matches the usual
PyTorch convention of data-parallel outermost.

  """Computes a topology-aware rank layout tensor, without building a mesh.

  Returns an int64 tensor of global torch ranks with shape `mesh_shape` (for
  topology="multi_slice": elementwise `dcn_mesh_shape * mesh_shape`), suitable
  for passing directly to `DeviceMesh(device_type, mesh=...)` or any other
  consumer of rank layouts (custom mesh construction, layout benchmarking).

  Deterministic across ranks: every rank derives the layout from the same
  all-gathered device payloads, satisfying DeviceMesh's requirement that the
  mesh tensor is identical on all ranks. Requires an initialized process group.


  Args:
    device_type: Device type for the mesh. Non-TPU device types are delegated to
      `torch.distributed.init_device_mesh` unchanged.
    mesh_shape: Logical mesh shape, ordered by increasing network intensity.
    topology: "single_slice" (default) arranges a single slice over ICI via
      mesh_utils.create_device_mesh; "multi_slice" uses
      create_hybrid_device_mesh for meshes spanning a slower outer network —
      pass dcn_mesh_shape, and set process_is_granule=True to make *hosts* the
      outer granule.
    dcn_mesh_shape: Outer (slower network) mesh shape for "multi_slice". The
      returned mesh has shape `dcn_mesh_shape * mesh_shape` elementwise.
    process_is_granule: Treat processes (hosts) rather than slices as the
      outer-network granule in "multi_slice" mode.
    allow_split_physical_axes: Forwarded to mesh_utils; permits splitting a
      physical axis across logical axes when required to realize mesh_shape.
    contiguous_submeshes: Forwarded to mesh_utils.create_device_mesh.

  Returns:
    An int64 tensor of global torch ranks mapping the requested virtual layout
    coordinates.

  Raises:
    RuntimeError: If the PyTorch process group is not initialized, or if there
      are duplicate PJRT device IDs across torch ranks.
    ValueError: If an unknown topology string is provided or if multi_slice mode
      is missing dcn_mesh_shape.
