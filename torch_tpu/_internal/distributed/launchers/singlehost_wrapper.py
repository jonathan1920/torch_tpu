"""An example wrapper for using torchrun with single-host distributed TorchTPU.

This sets up the environment variables expected by the `torch_tpu` library
for distributed TorchTPU tests on a single host. Enables tests to be run
with torchrun as follows:

The torchrun command is called on a wrapper around user logic:

```
g3_distributed.torchrun(
    tpu_env_wrapper(user_logic, arg1, arg2, world_size=N),
    nproc_per_node=N,
)()
```

The tpu_env_wrapper performs the following setup in the main process before
torchrun spawns worker processes:
1. Sets TORCH_TPU_SLICEBUILDER_ADDRESSES by finding N unused ports on localhost.
2. Detects and sets TORCH_TPU_TOPOLOGY.
3. Sets TORCH_TPU_XPROF_SESSION_ID.

Then, torchrun spawns N worker processes, each of which runs `user_logic` with
RANK, LOCAL_RANK, and WORLD_SIZE set in environment variables.
