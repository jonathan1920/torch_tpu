"""Utility functions for materializing and synchronizing TPU tensors.

In eager mode, tensors in torch_tpu are sometimes deferred, meaning that they
have a pending operation that needs to be compiled and executed before their
data is available.

Accessing the data of a deferred tensor (through .cpu(), .item(), or similar)
always forces the following steps:
  1. Graph traversal: the deferred operations graph is analyzed and prepared
  2. Compilation: the graph is compiled into executable code
  3. Materialization: the execution is scheduled, and a PjRtBuffer is created
     to hold the future result
  4. Synchronization: waiting for the running executable to complete
  5. Transfer: copying data from device to host

However, in some cases it can be useful to only materialize and/or synchronize.
  * Manual materialization splits the deferred op graph, resulting in multiple
    smaller compilation steps. This can reduce compilation time, but may result
    in a less efficient executable.
  * Manual materialization can be used to insert breakpoints in loops, reusing
    a cached compilation across each iteration.
  * Manual materialization can be used to profile compilation time, while
    avoiding the overhead of data transfer and execution.
  * Manual synchronization can be used to profile the combined compilation and
    execution time; or, if the compilation is cached, the execution time alone.

These are not intended as the primary interface for users. These are currently
only used internally for performance evaluation by the torch_tpu developers.
