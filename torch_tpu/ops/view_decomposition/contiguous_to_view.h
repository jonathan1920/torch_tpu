// Converts a contiguous tensor to a view tensor with equivalent logical values
// and specified target strides and storage offset.
//
// This is effectively the opposite of `torch.Tensor.contiguous()`.
// That function operates by taking a view tensor, which may be non-dense,
// broadcasted, or strided in a complex overlapping pattern, and copies it into
// a contiguous tensor.
//
// To invert this, we instead take a contiguous buffer, allocate a new storage,
// and copy non-overlapping windows of data from the contiguous tensor into
// the new storage, such that the desired view will read the correct values.
//
// Note that because `torch.Tensor.contiguous` may result in data duplication
// when copying out broadcasted or overlapping views, this inverse operation may
// deduplicate data. If the contiguous buffer does not actually have duplicate
// data in the expected locations, then this results in a "last write wins"
// behavior.
//
// Additionally note that because `torch.Tensor.contiguous` may remove data from
// the original storage not accessible to the view, this function may insert
// new dummy data of NaNs or max-value integers (following the policy of
// `torch.utils.deterministic.fill_uninitialized_memory`) in those gaps. This
// will not affect the logical values of the returned view tensor, but later
// uses of `torch.as_strided` may recover this "zombie data" if they create an
// out-of-bounds striding on the output view.
//
// In the case where the target strides are already contiguous, this is a no-op
// and just returns the contiguous buffer (wrapping it in an at::Tensor).
// In the case where the target strides are non-overlapping (permitting simple
// broadcasts), this will perform a single write operation (see inversion.cc).
