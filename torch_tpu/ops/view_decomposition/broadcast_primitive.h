// Broadcast (full name: stablehlo::BroadcastInDim) is a view primitive. It
// inserts dimensions into a tensor, reorders them, and/or increases dimensions
// with size = 1 to arbitrary size.

// Note that this is a primitive in StableHLO; in torch, these three operations
// would need to be implemented either separately as torch.unsqueeze,
// torch.expand, and torch.permute, or as a single as_strided operation.

//   - Mapping input dimension i to output dimension j as indicated by
//     broadcast_dimensions[i] = j
//   - Inserting dimensions of size new_sizes[j] for all output dimensions j not
//     mapped to by broadcast_dimensions.
//   - Expanding all mapped dimensions j to new_sizes[j], provided that either
//     input_sizes[i] == new_sizes[j] or input_sizes[i] == 1.
//
// Any inserted or expanded dimension will have stride 0, while any
// non-expanded dimension j will have the same stride as the corresponding
