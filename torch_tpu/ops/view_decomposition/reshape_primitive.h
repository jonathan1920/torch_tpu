// reinterprets a tensor shape as another tensor shape with the same number of
// elements.

// A reshape primitive converts an N-dimensional tensor into an
// M-dimensional tensor with shape given by new_sizes.
//
// For this to be a valid view, the total number of elements in the shapes must
// match, and the strides must only be reshaped within "contiguity-like" blocks,
// as described in
// https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Tensor.view.html.
// A "contiguity-like" block is one where size[i] == size[i+1] * stride[i+1] for
// some sequence of k dimensions (trivially true for k == 1).
//
// There must be an equal number of contiguity-like blocks in the input and
// output, and the element count of each block must be equal in the 1:1 mapping
// of the input and output.
//
// If this condition holds, then the resulting strides of the new shapes are:
//   * new_strides[j] == input_strides[i] if i, j are the last indices of
//     their respective contiguity-like blocks, and
//   * new_strides[j] == new_strides[j+1] * new_sizes[j+1] otherwise.
//
// Simplifications:
//   * If new_sizes == input_sizes, then this is a no-op and can be skipped.
//   * Back-to-back reshapes are redundant, only the second reshape is needed.
