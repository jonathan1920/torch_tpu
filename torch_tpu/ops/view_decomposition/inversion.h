// PyTorch supports mutation tensor data through shallows views. That is, you
// can do operations like
// ```python
// x = torch.zeros(3)
// y = x[1]
// y += 1
// print(x)
// ```
// and the expected result is `[0, 1, 0]`.
//
// However, PjRtBuffers are generally immutable; we can change `x` to be
// a pointer to a new buffer, but we cannot directly edit the value of `x[1]`
// like CPU or CUDA devices can. Instead, we need to combine the old, unmodified
// buffer with the updated view to create a new buffer with the mutated value.
//
// To construct this new buffer, we need to be able to *invert* the view being
// mutated. This requires having:
//   * The contiguous base tensor with the pre-update values; in the above
//     example, this is (`[0, 0, 0]`)
//   * The stride pattern of the view that has been updated; in the above
//     example, this is (size=(), stride=(), offset=1)
//   * The updated values of the view; in the above example, this is scalar `1`
//   * The element type of the base tensor and the view.
//
// We first need to cast both tensors to a common dtype. To ensure no loss of
// data, we need to carefully handle two cases:
//   * If the dtypes are different sizes, we need to cast both tensors to the
//     smaller bitwidth of the two dtypes to avoid truncation, and ensure that
//     partial updates to larger base elements preserve unmodified bits.
///  * If the contiguous base tensor is boolean type, then it needs to be
//     converted to a uint8 tensor to preserve all assigned bytes (and not
//     collapse them to only 0x00 or 0x01 values).
//
// Once the types are aligned, we can compute the shape-only decomposition from
// the base tensor to the view using the logic in decomposition.h, and then
// invert the operations:
//   * Reshape is inverted by another reshape
//   * Transpose is inverted by another transpose
//   * Slice is inverted by a pad
//   * Pad is inverted by a slice
//
// Once we have the inverse operations, we can construct two update tensors:
//   * A tensor with the same values as the updated view (possibly bitcasted),
//     but in their original positions relative to the base tensor. Any values
//     not present in the view are replaced with arbitrary padding (zeroes).
//   * A mask tensor with `true` in all positions that were updated and `false`
//     in all other positions.
// These can then be combined with StableHLO select (equivalent to torch.where)
// to compute the updated contiguous base tensor.
//
// If there are no pads in the inverse (no slices in the view) then the mask
// would be all `true` and we can avoid the final select.
// If there is a single pad at the end with no interior padding then the more
// performant dynamic_update_slice can be used instead of pad+select.
//
// Note that overlapping views (including broadcasted dimensions) are not
// invertible. This is because if multiple index values refer to the same
// physical memory location, then writing to those indexes creates multiple
// competing writes to that location, which has undefined behavior (on CPU,
// CUDA, and TPU alike). We raise an exception in this case.

namespace torch_tpu {

// Only some view primitives can be trivially inverted with no ambiguity or loss
// of information.
//
// The invertible operations are:
// * Reshapes and transposes are invertible, as they preserve all data.
//   Reshapes are inverted by reshape, transpose is inverted by transpose.
// * Pads are invertible because dummy pad values do not need to be preserved.
//   Pads are inverted by slice.
// * Conj is invertible because it only flips the sign bit of the imag part.
//   Conj is inverted by conj to undo the flip.
//
// For the other operations:
// * Some bitcasts are invertible, but others cause a loss of information (for
//   example, uint8 -> bool); these are handled separately.
// * Slices are not trivially invertible, as they remove data. These require
//   handling using dynamic update slice or stablehlo.select to merge with the
//   pre-slice value.
// * BroadcastInDim and Unfold are not invertible as they are one-to-many, not
//   one-to-one, which is undefined behavior when inverted.
