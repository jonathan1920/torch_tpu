  """Gates whether cumulative ops may emit the native scan emitter.

  Cumulative ops (cumsum/cumprod/cummax/cummin/logcumsumexp) lower to the native
  scan emitter (chlo.ScanOp), which needs a libtpu new enough to compile it.
  Internal builds always do; OSS pins a wheel that may not, so gate on the
  libtpu
  version and fall back to the while-loop lowering otherwise (b/529376045).

  This MUST run after libtpu.configure_library_path(): importing the
  _internal.env C++ extension runs static initializers that register the TPU
  PJRT plugin and require TPU_LIBRARY_PATH, which configure_library_path() sets.
  Importing env before that aborts with "TPU_LIBRARY_PATH is not set", so the
  import is kept local to this function rather than at module top.
