"""Holds the XLA commit and sha for easy automated updating."""

# To update XLA to a new revision,
# a) update XLA_COMMIT to the new git commit hash. Using JAX's XLA commit
#    is a good reference point.
# b) get the sha256 hash of the commit by running:
#    curl -L https://github.com/openxla/xla/archive/{git_hash}.tar.gz | sha256sum
#    and update XLA_SHA256 with the result.

XLA_COMMIT = "77674103aaa978d6b8f50b777ede7d5a8686347a"
XLA_SHA256 = "d22064afc8348841b2cbf9adf9a7c7be76f5e8357f2e4fd64513bf6c639279d8"
