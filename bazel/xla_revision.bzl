"""Holds the XLA commit and sha for easy automated updating."""

# To update XLA to a new revision,
# a) update XLA_COMMIT to the new git commit hash. Using JAX's XLA commit
#    is a good reference point.
# b) get the sha256 hash of the commit by running:
#    curl -L https://github.com/openxla/xla/archive/{git_hash}.tar.gz | sha256sum
#    and update XLA_SHA256 with the result.

XLA_COMMIT = "f30e0a0c611366fbb73d0673df1c13085d865375"
XLA_SHA256 = "92242e859996889dbc3be9005f88407c62a3af7a8214c9d449756152c7603a09"
