"""Holds the XLA commit and sha for easy automated updating."""

# To update XLA to a new revision,
# a) update XLA_COMMIT to the new git commit hash. Using JAX's XLA commit
#    is a good reference point.
# b) get the sha256 hash of the commit by running:
#    curl -L https://github.com/openxla/xla/archive/{git_hash}.tar.gz | sha256sum
#    and update XLA_SHA256 with the result.

XLA_COMMIT = "cdbd8b766ff6992238c1127b58e61dbb3e56a5f3"
XLA_SHA256 = "671c078747e1ce4f9a9cd628f1344a4a3b739cadb7f06718ab42f4d524b8b96c"
