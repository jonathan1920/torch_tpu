"""Holds the XLA commit and sha for easy automated updating."""

# To update XLA to a new revision,
# a) update XLA_COMMIT to the new git commit hash. Using JAX's XLA commit
#    is a good reference point.
# b) get the sha256 hash of the commit by running:
#    curl -L https://github.com/openxla/xla/archive/{git_hash}.tar.gz | sha256sum
#    and update XLA_SHA256 with the result.

XLA_COMMIT = "5e6d50f1eb0c29b55b40862c67015ca47533516e"
XLA_SHA256 = "fea821fc3925d6318625a76719253ab09f758b12ea467f213bea9cd050f4a89c"
