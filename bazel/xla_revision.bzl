"""Holds the XLA commit and sha for easy automated updating."""

# To update XLA to a new revision,
# a) update XLA_COMMIT to the new git commit hash. Using JAX's XLA commit
#    is a good reference point.
# b) get the sha256 hash of the commit by running:
#    curl -L https://github.com/openxla/xla/archive/{git_hash}.tar.gz | sha256sum
#    and update XLA_SHA256 with the result.

XLA_COMMIT = "356bc5e569f308aae404780aa084baa697752bf5"
XLA_SHA256 = "e46ebd9a8271ce9394d51c765487947ee6619cd25dbbbd62644eecc0deb998f9"
