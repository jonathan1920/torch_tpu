# DESCRIPTION:
#   This script is a standalone, manually-executed infrastructure script. It is
#   not executed during the automated CI build process.
#
#   It generates a custom, hermetic CPython 3.12 tarball instrumented with
#   ThreadSanitizer (TSan), along with a standalone TSan shared library. These 2
#   artifacts are uploaded to GCS and downloaded by Bazel during CI tests.
#   1. The tarball is required because standard Python is uninstrumented and
#      will break TSan's memory tracking. Standard Python interpreters are not
#      compiled with TSan. If we execute TSan-instrumented PyTorch extensions
#      inside a standard Python environment, TSan misinterprets Python's
#      internal thread management (like the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)) and
#      memory allocation, resulting in a flood of false-positive data races that
#      completely mask the real PyTorch bugs.
#   2. The .so file is required because Python imports C++ extensions using
#      dlopen with the RTLD_LOCAL flag. This hides the extension's symbols,
#      causing PyTorch to drop the TSan runtime and fail with undefined symbol:
#      __tsan_func_entry.
#
#   Lineage & Modifications:
#   This script is adapted from rules_ml_toolchain's reference script:
#   https://github.com/google-ml-infra/rules_ml_toolchain/blob/75b375bcf42810358974dd21c8da600d1f81cb01/py/dist/build-python-tsan-x86_64-ubuntu20.sh#L1-L79.
#   However, the original script was designed for Python 3.13/3.14
#   "Free Threading" (no-GIL) builds. Since our project requires Python 3.12,
#   the following critical modifications were made:
#   1. No Free-Threading flags: Python 3.12 does not support `--disable-gil`,
#      `--with-mimalloc`, or the native `--with-thread-sanitizer` configure
#      flags. Instead, we manually pass `-fsanitize=thread` via BASECFLAGS and
#      LDFLAGS to force TSan instrumentation onto the standard Python 3.12 build.
#   2. ABI matching: Instead of using `wget` to download a generic LLVM release
#      from GitHub, this script dynamically triggers Bazel and extracts the
#      exact LLVM 20 toolchain from Bazel's cache. This guarantees ABI
#      compatibility with the compiled PyTorch/XLA C++ extensions.
#   3. Dynamic library discovery: Hardcoded Ubuntu 20.04 library paths
#      (e.g., libssl.so.1.1) were replaced with dynamic resolution to allow
#      execution on newer runner images (like Ubuntu 22.04 with libssl.so.3).
#
# TODO: b/512474130 - Automate this process and/or make it config-based.
# Investigate building a reusable solution as a shared utility across projects.
# USAGE:
#   ONLY modify and run this script in the following scenarios:
#   1. The project changes to a new Python version.
#   2. The LLVM toolchain version is bumped.
#   3. The host OS (Ubuntu) is upgraded. The script bundles system libraries
#      like libssl and libffi, so a major glibc or OpenSSL change in the runner
#      environment might require a fresh tarball.

#   Permissions needed:
#   - The script is executable. Anyone with read access can run it.
#   - The GCS bucket gs://ml-sysroot-testing/python/ is publicly readable.
#     Contact ML Velocity team for write access.
#
#   Steps:
#   1. Run the script in the root of the torch_tpu repository:
#      $ ./ci/configs/build_hermetic_tsan_python.sh
#      Outputs are generated in /tmp/tsan_python_build/:
#        1. cpython-3.12.x-tsan-shared-linux-x86_64-llvm-20-bazel-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz
#        2. libclang_rt.tsan-llvm20-YYYYMMDD.so
#
#   2. Upload the timestamped outputs (in /tmp/tsan_python_build/) to the GCS
#      bucket:
#      $ gcloud storage cp /tmp/tsan_python_build/cpython-3.12.x-tsan-shared-linux-x86_64-llvm-20-bazel-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz gs://ml-sysroot-testing/python/
#      $ gcloud storage cp /tmp/tsan_python_build/libclang_rt.tsan-llvm20-YYYYMMDD.so gs://ml-sysroot-testing/python/
#      Uploaded files can be found at https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/ml-sysroot-testing/python/.
#
#   3. Update hashes in .bazelrc and MODULE.bazel with the output provided at
#      the end of the script.
