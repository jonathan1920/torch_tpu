# Kokoro orchestration for the TorchTPU wheel build, located in the OSS repo.
#
# This script is orchestration ONLY: it provisions the build container and
# collects artifacts for Kokoro. Everything about how the wheel is actually
# built -- the bazel target, flags, and version-suffix handling -- lives in
# the shared ci/build_wheels.sh, which the GitHub CI uses too, so the wheels
# published from here are built exactly like the wheels CI smoke-tests. The
# only Kokoro-specific bazel flag is --config=no_rbe: this environment has no
# RBE credentials.
