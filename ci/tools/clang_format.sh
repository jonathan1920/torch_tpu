# This script is the core execution engine for checking and applying C++
# formatting rules using `clang-format-diff.py`.
#
# Design Intent (Incremental Formatting):
#   Instead of blindly formatting the entire repository, this script uses
#   `git diff` against a base tracking branch ($BASE_SHA). It strictly evaluates
#   and formats only the specific lines modified in the current Pull Request or
#   local working tree.
#
# Modes:
#   - 'lint'   : Used by CI. Detects formatting violations, prints the diff,
#                outputs self-serve fix instructions, and exits with a failure
#                code.
#   - 'format' : Used locally by developers. Blindly applies fixes to modified
#                lines in-place without failing.
set -euo pipefail

# Fall back to origin/main if BASE_SHA isn't passed by CI.
BASE_SHA="${BASE_SHA:-origin/main}"
# Default to empty so an omitted mode reaches the usage help message
# instead of aborting with an "unbound variable" error.
MODE="${1:-}"

# Tell the user how to run this script correctly. Users may be tempted to run the script
# directly instead of through tox.
