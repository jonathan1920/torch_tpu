"""Deciding whether the chip under an agent is still usable.

The rule that shapes everything here: a quarantine that fires wrongly
removes a working chip from a 28-chip fleet, so output text alone never
quarantines anything. Suspicious output only asks the probe to look. The
probe decides. The one exception is a missing device node, which is not
ambiguous.
