"""Pairing a worker with a TPU, once, at boot.

A worker takes a chip when it starts and keeps it. The claim is a single
`ifGenerationMatch=0` write, which Cloud Storage resolves atomically, so
there is no agreement protocol and nothing to coordinate. After boot the
hot path does no locking at all: every action that lands on a worker
already knows which chip it owns.
