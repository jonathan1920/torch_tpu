"""Runs the relay agent. One of these per TPU VM, under systemd.

Settings come from the environment:

  TORCH_TPU_RELAY_BUCKET   relay bucket name (required)
  TORCH_TPU_RELAY_TPU      this VM's TPU name (required)
  TORCH_TPU_RELAY_ROOT     scratch directory, default /tmp/torch_tpu_relay
  TORCH_TPU_RELAY_CHIP_PROBE  probe command, default is a device node check

The TPU name is required rather than guessed. A TPU VM's hostname is not
its TPU name, and getting it wrong would have an agent serve somebody
else's mailbox.
