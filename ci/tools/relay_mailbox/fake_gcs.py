"""An in-memory stand-in for Cloud Storage.

The binding protocol is only safe if generation preconditions behave the
way Cloud Storage says they do, so this fake models them precisely and the
tests assert against it. It is locked because the interesting tests run
several binders against one bucket at the same time.
