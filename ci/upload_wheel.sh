# A script to upload Python wheels to Artifact Registry.
#
# Usage:
#   ./upload_wheel.sh <WHEEL_PATTERN>
#
# Arguments:
#   WHEEL_PATTERN: Required. Filename glob/pattern of wheels in dist/ to upload
#                  (e.g., "torch_tpu-*.whl", "tpu_sync_torch-*.whl").
#
# Environment Variables:
#   UPLOAD_WHEEL_TO_AR: Optional. Whether to upload wheels to Artifact Registry.
#                       Defaults to "true". Set to "false" to skip upload.
#   KOKORO_ARTIFACTS_DIR: Optional. Base directory containing the dist/ folder.
#                         Defaults to "$(pwd)/../../artifacts".
#
# Examples:
#   ./upload_wheel.sh "torch_tpu-*.whl"
#   ./upload_wheel.sh "tpu_sync_torch-*.whl"
