# Builds the torch_tpu wheel for one or more Python versions.
#
# This is the single source of truth for how a torch_tpu wheel is built:
# every meaningful build flag lives here, so the wheels the CI smoke tests
# exercise and the wheels the Kokoro publisher uploads come from the same
# invocation. Callers (.github/actions/build-wheel, ci/build_wheel.sh) only
# orchestrate the environment: where the container runs, where the wheels
# go, and environment-specific bazel flags (e.g. Kokoro passes
# --config=no_rbe because it has no RBE credentials; presubmit does not).
#
# Usage:
#   ci/build_wheels.sh [--release] [--output-dir DIR] PY_VERSION... [-- BAZEL_ARG...]
#
#   --release       Build a release wheel: no .devTIMESTAMP version suffix.
#                   The default is a dev build, whose suffix is computed once
#                   here so every Python version in one invocation shares the
#                   same version string.
#   --output-dir    Directory the built wheels are copied into (default: dist).
#   PY_VERSION...   Python versions to build for, e.g. "3.11 3.12".
#   BAZEL_ARG...    Extra bazel flags appended to the build (after `--`).
