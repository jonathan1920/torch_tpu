"""Tests that zero-size tensors work correctly.

'Zero-size' means tensors with 0 total elements. This is distinct from both
0-dimensional tensors (e.g. scalars) which have 1 element, and empty
tensors (e.g. torch.empty(1, 2, 3)), which represent a non-zero number of
elements but have uninitialized memory.
