  """Stress test for RNG state and random operations.

  This test verifies that concurrent calls to random operations from multiple
  threads do not cause RNG state collisions (e.g., due to lack of proper
  locking).

  Testing Approach and Assumptions:
  - The test runs random operations concurrently in multiple threads and asserts
    that all generated tensors are unique.F
  - For F32 tensors of size 100, the probability of two different threads
    generating the exact same tensor by chance is extremely low (approx
    (1/2^24)^100 for uniform distribution). Thus, collisions are strong evidence
    of state sharing.
  - The test also asserts that the global RNG state offset increments by the
    expected amount (num_threads * offset_increments).

  Limitations:
  - The "all-unique" check is probabilistic. It cannot strictly prove that no
    collision occurred, nor that collisions will never occur.
  - Checking offset increments depends on internal RNG algorithm details (e.g.,
    Philox step size) and is not purely testing user-facing behavior.

  Why an Unsound Approach was Chosen:
  - An ideal test would read the RNG state directly after each operation to
    ensure uniqueness. However, in a multi-threaded environment, `op_fn()` and
    `get_state()` calls cannot be made atomic without adding extra locking
    that would defeat the purpose of the test.
  - OS thread switching between `op_fn()` and `get_state()` leads to threads
    reading the same advanced state, causing false positives (failed tests) even
    when locking is correct.
  - Peeking into internal kernel state during execution is not feasible with
    current infrastructure. Therefore, we settle for this E2E stress test with
    numeric checks and offset verification as a practical compromise.
