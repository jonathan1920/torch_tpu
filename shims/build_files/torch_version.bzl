"""Transitions for building torch_tpu against multiple PyTorch versions.

The `//:_torch_version` flag reconfigures the whole build graph, including the
XLA/MLIR backend that does not actually depend on PyTorch. To keep the shared
backend in a single configuration (so pywrap factors it into one common library
instead of one copy per PyTorch version), `reset_torch_config` re-exports a
target under a transition that pins `//:_torch_version` to a canonical value.

`torch_version_glue` is the dual: it re-exports a `pybind_extension` under a
transition that *sets* `//:_torch_version` to a specific value, so the same
extension source is compiled once per supported PyTorch version. The versioned
`.so`s (built by the wheel `pywrap_library`) share the single XLA/MLIR common
library produced under the pinned config above.
