    To prevent memory bloat and reduce the risk of **Out-of-Memory (OOM)** errors, avoid loading large models on the CPU and moving them to TPU via `.to(device)`. Instead, use the `torch.device` context manager to allocate parameters directly on TPU High Bandwidth Memory (HBM).

    ## **3. Understanding the Compute Model**
    TorchTPU supports two distinct execution paths:

    * **Eager (Deferred) Mode:** Operations are recorded into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). They are executed only when a value is needed (e.g., calling `.item()` or `.cpu()`).
    * **Compiled Mode:** `torch.compile` captures the entire graph Ahead-of-Time (AOT). This allows the XLA compiler to perform cross-operator fusions and layout optimizations not possible in Eager mode.
    * **Materialization:** Results from a compiled model are returned as **Materialized** tensors (physical buffers on the TPU), ensuring hardware completion before returning to Python.

    ## **4. Architectural Constraints**

    ### **Static Shapes Requirement**
    The XLA compiler, in order to achieve maximum performance, compiles all computations using their specific (i.e. static) shapes. This means that changes to shapes (i.e. dynamic shapes) require recompilations, which can be time consuming.
    * **Strict Enforcement:** You **must** set `dynamic=False` in `torch.compile`.
    * **Behavior:** The backend will fail or trigger frequent re-compilations if shapes vary at runtime.

    ## **5. Advanced Optimization: Compiling the Training Step**
    For maximum throughput, compile the **entire training step function** rather than just the model. This allows XLA to generate a **joint forward-backward graph**, optimizing memory reuse and buffer donation across the entire training iteration.
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > **Stateful Optimizers:** When using stateful optimizers (like `Adam`, `AdamW`, `Adamax`, `ASGD`, `NAdam`, `RAdam`, `RMSProp`, or `Rprop`) with `torch.compile` on TPU, you **must** pass `capturable=True` during initialization. This ensures the optimizer's lazy state tensors (e.g., momentum) are safely captured into the XLA graph instead of crashing as CPU tensors.
