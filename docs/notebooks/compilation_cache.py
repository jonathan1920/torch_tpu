    # **The Compilation Cache**

    Understanding "Cold Starts" vs. "Warm Hits" is essential for achieving peak TPU performance. This guide explains how graph fingerprints are generated, why compilation storms happen, and how to ensure your training loop stays on the fast path.

    ## **How the Cache Works**

    The first time a specific sequence of operations is executed, the backend must compile it into TPU machine code. This is a **"Cold Start"** and for large models, can add up to several seconds or even minutes.

    Once compiled, the resulting binary is stored in the **Compilation Cache**. The second time you run same sequence of ops (e.g., iteration 2 of a training loop), it will be a **"Warm Hit"** and execution starts instantly.

    ```
    Iteration 1:  Record Graph → Fingerprint → Cache MISS → Compile → Execute → Store in Cache
    Iteration 2:  Record Graph → Fingerprint → Cache HIT  → Execute (instant)
    Iteration 3:  Record Graph → Fingerprint → Cache HIT  → Execute (instant)
    ...
    ```

    ## **Graph Fingerprinting**

    The backend generates a **fingerprint** for each computation graph based on:

    1. **Input shapes** — e.g., `[32, 128]` vs. `[16, 128]` Note that **input scalar** values also affect the fingerprint.
    2. **Input dtypes** — e.g., `float32` vs. `bfloat16`
    3. **Sequence of operations** — the exact ATen ops in order

    If **any** of these change, the fingerprint most likely changes, and the cache produces a **miss** — triggering a full compilation.

    You can audit your cache performance directly from Python to ensure your training loop is hitting the "Warm" path.

    ## **Avoiding Unnecessary Recompilations**
    If your input shapes change every iteration (e.g., variable sequence lengths without padding), or if you have data-dependent operations (e.g. nonzero()), the backend may generate a new fingerprint and trigger a re-compilation of the changed ops.

    | Scenario | Fingerprints | Performance |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | Fixed batch size (32), fixed sequence length (128) | 1 unique graph | ✅ Fast — always cache hits |
    | Fixed batch size (32), 3 sequence buckets (128, 512, 1024) | 3 unique graphs | ✅ Good — 3 cold starts, then all hits |
    | Variable sequence lengths (every batch different) | N unique graphs | ❌ Re-compilation |

    A common cause of recompilation in production is an inconsistent batch size.

    * **Scenario:** Batch size = 32, dataset has 100 samples. Batches 1–3 are size 32, but batch 4 is size 4.
    * **Result:** The shape change (32 → 4) triggers re-compilation on the last step of **every epoch**.
    * **Solution:** Use `drop_last=True` in your DataLoader.

    ```python
    train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
        dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True,
        drop_last=True  # CRITICAL for TPU performance
    )

    ## **Warmup Runs**

    When measuring step time, make sure to exclude the first few steps as that can include the warmup (compilation) phase.

    **Recommendation:** Run 2 to 3 warmup iterations before starting your timer.

    ```python
    # Warmup iterations to populate the cache
    for _ in range(2):
        output = model(warmup_data)
        output.cpu()  # Force materialization → compilation

    # Now start measuring real performance
    start_time = time.time()
    # ... actual training loop ...

    Use the above compilation cache statistics API after a handful of steps to ensure there are no more recompilations.
