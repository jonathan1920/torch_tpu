    # **Eager Mode and Execution Control**

    This guide provides an overview of TorchTPU's execution modes. TorchTPU supports multiple ways to dispatch operations to the hardware, ranging from standard eager execution to highly optimized fused execution.

    ## **Execution Modes**

    TorchTPU provides three primary execution modes. By default, it operates in **Strict Eager** mode, which behaves similarly to standard PyTorch on CUDA.

    | Mode | Constant | Description |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | **Strict Eager** | `EagerMode.DEFER_NEVER` | **The default mode.** Operations are dispatched to the hardware immediately. Simplest for debugging and aligns with CUDA behavior. |
    | **Fused Eager** | `EagerMode.DEFER_AND_FUSE` | **Optimized mode.** Groups multiple operations together, allowing the XLA compiler to optimize across operation boundaries for high performance. |
    | **Debug Eager** | `EagerMode.DEFER_NEVER_AND_LAUNCH_BLOCKING` | **Synchronous mode.** Executes operations immediately and waits for completion. Best for pinpointing exactly which line caused a hardware error. |

    ### **Switching Modes**
    You can change the execution mode globally or locally using the `eager_mode` context manager:

    ```python
    from torch_tpu._internal import execution_mode as em

    # Enable Fused Eager for a specific block of code
    with em.eager_mode(em.EagerMode.DEFER_AND_FUSE):
        output = model(input_data)
    ```
    """)
  return


@app.cell
def init():
  import torch
  from torch_tpu import api
  from torch_tpu._internal import execution_mode as em

  # Standard hardware initialization
  api.tpu_device()
  return em, torch


@app.cell(hide_code=True)
def _(mo):
  mo.md(r"""
    ## **Demonstrating the Difference**

    In **Strict Eager** (default), operations happen one by one. In **Fused Eager**, operations are recorded into a graph and only executed when necessary (materialization) or when a large enough block is formed.

def modes_demo(em, torch):
  from torch_tpu._internal.sync import sync

  def check_fusion(mode_name, mode):

      # Perform a simple calculation

      y = x + 1
      z = y * 2

      # computation_mlir returns the StableHLO graph for the given tensor.
      # If fused, it will contain 'add' and 'multiply' operations.
      mlir = sync.computation_mlir(z)

    ## **Why Use Fused Eager?**

    While **Strict Eager** is the most intuitive for development, **Fused Eager** (`DEFER_AND_FUSE`) provides significant performance advantages for production training:

    1. **Fusion & Optimization:** Grouping operations allows XLA to reduce memory traffic by fusing multiple logical steps (like a `Linear` layer followed by a `ReLU`) into a single hardware kernel.
    2. **Memory Efficiency:** Intermediate results in a fused block often don't need to be stored in physical TPU memory (HBM), reducing the memory footprint.
    3. **Reduced Dispatch Overhead:** It minimizes the "chatter" between the CPU and TPU by sending larger, more meaningful chunks of work at once.

    > [!TIP]
    > For the absolute best performance, consider using `torch.compile(model, backend="tpu")`, which uses an even more aggressive Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation strategy.

    ## **Factory Methods and Materialization**

    Even in **Fused Eager** mode, certain operations trigger immediate execution (materialization):

    *   **`.item()`, `.cpu()`, `.tolist()`:** These force the data to be synchronized with the host CPU.
    *   **`print(tensor)`:** To display values, the data must be materialized.
    *   **Data-dependent control flow:** `if (tensor > 0).all():` implicitly materializes the tensor.
