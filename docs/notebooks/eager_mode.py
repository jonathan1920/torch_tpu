    # **Eager Mode and Execution Control**

    This guide provides an overview of TorchTPU's execution modes. TorchTPU supports multiple ways to dispatch operations to the hardware, ranging from standard eager execution to highly optimized fused execution.

    ## **Execution Modes**

    TorchTPU provides three execution modes. By default, it operates in **Strict Eager** mode, which behaves similarly to standard PyTorch on CUDA.

    | Mode | Constant | Description |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | **Strict Eager** | `EagerMode.DEFER_NEVER` | **The default mode.** Operations are dispatched one at a time and the execution is asynchronous. This aligns with standard PyTorch Eager mode on GPU. |
    | **Debug Eager** | `EagerMode.DEFER_NEVER_AND_LAUNCH_BLOCKING` | **Synchronous mode.** Operations are dispatched one at a time but execution is synchronous. This mode can also be enabled with the TPU_LAUNCH_BLOCKING="1" environment variable. This execution mode is similar to the CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING environment variable. |
    | **Fused Eager** | `EagerMode.DEFER_AND_FUSE` | **Optimized mode.** Groups multiple operations together, allowing the XLA compiler to fuse across operation boundaries for high performance. This mode can also be enabled with the TPU_DEFER_AND_FUSE="1" environment variable.|


    ### **Switching Modes**
    You can change the execution mode in two ways:

    #### **1. Globally (for the entire session)**
    Assign the desired mode to the `eager_mode` property:

    ```python
    from torch_tpu._internal import execution_mode as em

    # Switch to Strict Eager globally
    em.eager_mode = em.EagerMode.DEFER_NEVER
    ```

    #### **2. Locally (using a context manager)**
    Use `set_eager_mode` to temporarily override the mode for a block of code:

    ```python
    from torch_tpu._internal import execution_mode as em

    # Force every operation to execute immediately for this block
    with em.set_eager_mode(em.EagerMode.DEFER_NEVER):
        # Now you can pinpoint the exact line where an error occurs
        output = model(input_data)
    ```

    ## **Demonstrating the Difference**

    In **Strict Eager** (default), operations are executed one at a time. In **Fused Eager**, operations are deferred and only executed as larger chunks as necessary.

    ## **Why Use Fused Eager?**

    While **Strict Eager** is the most intuitive for development, **Fused Eager** (`DEFER_AND_FUSE`) provides significant performance advantages for production training:

    1. **Fusion & Optimization:** Grouping operations allows XLA to reduce memory traffic by fusing multiple logical steps (like a `Linear` layer followed by a `ReLU`) into a single hardware kernel.
    2. **Memory Efficiency:** Intermediate results in a fused block often don't need to be stored in physical TPU memory (HBM), reducing the memory footprint.
    3. **Reduced Dispatch Overhead:** It minimizes the "chatter" between the CPU and TPU by sending larger, more meaningful chunks of work at once.

    > [!TIP]
    > For the absolute best performance, consider using `torch.compile(model, backend="tpu")`, which uses an even more aggressive Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation strategy.

    ## **Factory Methods and Materialization**

    Even in **Fused Eager** mode, certain operations trigger immediate execution (materialization):

    *   **`.item()`, `.cpu()`, `.tolist()`:** These force the data to be synchronized with the host CPU.
    *   **`print(tensor)`:** To display values, the data must be materialized.
    *   **Data-dependent control flow:** `if (tensor > 0).all():` implicitly materializes the tensor.
