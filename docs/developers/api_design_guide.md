# TorchTPU API Design Guidelines

## Introduction

While TorchTPU aims at a great user experience out of the box, power users need
sophisticated control to get the exact behavior and performance they want. To
ensure a predictable and pleasant user experience, TorchTPU APIs need to follow
a common set of guidelines. This document presents such guidelines.

## Principles

This section contains the principles for defining APIs that affect TorchTPU's
behavior. APIs defined in tests, benchmarks, and examples are not governed by
these rules. While not all of our APIs follow these principles today, we shall
follow them in new code and migrate the existing APIs to conform to them.

*   APIs can be either **global** (affecting the entire process) or **local**
    (affecting a region of a particular thread).
*   General preferences
    *   Try not to invent new APIs; **prefer reusing an existing PyTorch API**
        if it can meet our needs well. This minimizes the user migration cost.
    *   Prefer
        [torch.accelerator](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/2.13/accelerator.html)
        over `torch.tpu`. The former makes it easier for the users to switch
        between different accelerator types.
*   Design choices
    *   For **global** APIs:
        *   Global knobs should always have a Python API, e.g.
            `torch.backends.tpu.allow_excess_precision = True` and
            `torch.set_float32_matmul_precision("highest")`.
            *   Prefer properties to getters/setters.
            *   A user can change the state of a global knob multiple times. In
                such cases, the latest change takes effect.
        *   Optionally, we permit configuring the default value of a global knob
            via an **environment variable**. Add this if we anticipate a need to
            tweak the knob without touching the model code (e.g. a knob used by
            the production operation team).
            *   If there's a
                [well-established PyTorch environment variable](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/2.13/torch_environment_variables.html)
                for controlling the behavior (e.g. `TORCH_TRACE` or
                `TORCH_SHOW_CPP_STACKTRACES`), we may reuse the same variable
                for TorchTPU to minimize the user migration cost.
            *   An environment variable introduced by TorchTPU should by default
                start with `TORCH_TPU_INTERNAL_`. If we want it to be usable by
                users, it should start with `TORCH_TPU_` without the `INTERNAL_`
                part. If the internal API becomes stable and we are comfortable
                letting users use it, it should be renamed to strip the
                `INTERNAL_` part at that time.
            *   When the environment variable is set and the Python API is
                called, the *latter* takes precedence.
        *   Use **C++ command-line flags** only for Google-internal knobs (e.g.
            it's for Google internal experiments and shouldn't be exposed to
            even power users), as there's no easy way to pass flags to TorchTPU
            in OSS.
            *   All TorchTPU flag names should start with `torch_tpu_internal_`.
        *   Do **NOT** use **Python command-line flags** (`flags.DEFINE_*`).
            They cause client programs that don't parse flags to crash with a
            "reading flag before flag parsing" error.
    *   Rules for **local** APIs:
        *   Local knobs should be implemented as Python **context managers**.
            Each context manager region governs the behavior of all enclosed
            PyTorch code in the current Python thread.
        *   A local knob overrides the corresponding global knob (if any), not
            the other way around. For example, the MLIR tracebacks can be
            controlled via either a global knob (the
            `--torch_tpu_internal_mlir_tracebacks` *internal* flag) or a local
            knob (the `enable_tracebacks` context manager); when both are
            present, the latter takes precedence.
*   Implementation choices
    *   For **global** APIs:
        *   Read a flag only once and memoize it. This ensures consistent
            behavior in case someone tampered with the flag at run time. Such
            read-only behavior aligns with how PyTorch handles knobs like
            `TORCH_SHOW_CPP_STACKTRACES`. To conform to this pattern, use the
            `ReadFlagOnce()` function to read a flag in C++.
        *   Similarly, read an environment variable only once and memoize it.
            Use `GetEnvOnce()` in C++ for this purpose.
        *   When a command-line flag is justified, implement it using the `absl`
            flag library (in both C++ and Python).
    *   For **local** APIs:
        *   It's important to follow TorchTPU Context Manager design pattern to
            implement a context manager (TODO: publish the context manager
            design guide). Otherwise its behavior may be incorrect.
