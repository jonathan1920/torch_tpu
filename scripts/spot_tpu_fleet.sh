# Brings up a fleet of Spot TPU v5e VMs and writes one session file per VM into
# a pool directory. Point TPU_SESSION_POOL at that directory and
# relay_test_runner.sh will lease a VM per test, so a single Bazel invocation
# spreads its test actions across the whole fleet.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/spot_tpu_fleet.sh up --size 10 [--pool DIR] [--zone ZONE] [--on-demand]
#                                [--deadline-minutes N]
#   scripts/spot_tpu_fleet.sh down [--pool DIR]
#   scripts/spot_tpu_fleet.sh attach [--pool DIR] [--zone ZONE] [--ssh-user USER]
#                                    [--ssh-identity PATH] [--no-key-push]
#                                    [--name-prefix PREFIX] [--accelerator-type TYPE]
#   scripts/spot_tpu_fleet.sh detach [--pool DIR]
#   scripts/spot_tpu_fleet.sh status [--pool DIR]
#
# `up` arms a detached deadline that runs `down` after --deadline-minutes, so a
# fleet cannot outlive a crashed orchestrator. Pass 0 to turn it off. `down`
# cancels it.
#
# `attach` joins a fleet somebody else already brought up: it lists the VMs,
# pushes the caller's SSH key to each one and writes the session files. It never
# creates or deletes a VM and never arms a deadline. `detach` drops the session
# files again and leaves the VMs running. Use that pair from CI against a
# long-lived pool, so a finished job cannot delete hardware another job is using.
#
# By default `attach` only picks up VMs this script created, whose names start
# with spot-tpu-v5e-. Reserved capacity is usually named something else, so
# --name-prefix widens the search; pass an empty prefix to consider every VM in
# the zone. Widening the name never widens what `down` deletes: the orphan sweep
# is pinned to the creation prefix on purpose.
#
#   # Borrow a reserved fleet named reserved-v5e-*.
#   scripts/spot_tpu_fleet.sh attach --name-prefix reserved-v5e- --zone us-east5-b
#
#   # Borrow every single-chip v5e in the zone, whatever it is called.
#   scripts/spot_tpu_fleet.sh attach --name-prefix '' --zone us-east5-b
#
# --accelerator-type guards the widened search. The relay leases one chip per
# test action, so attaching a v5p or a multi-chip host would burn a full timeout
# per test and report as an ordinary failure. It defaults to v5litepod-1.
#
# `attach` claims each VM it takes by leaving a marker on it, and walks past VMs
# somebody else is holding. Without that, two people attaching at the same time
# both take the whole fleet and run two tests on every chip. `detach` drops the
# marker; a claim nobody released ages out after --claim-ttl seconds (4h).
# --force-claim takes a VM anyway, --no-claim turns the whole thing off.
